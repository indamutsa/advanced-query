# # Pseudocode in natural language showcasing system capabilities
# I want to get all models that:
#     - conform to metamodel MM_1
#     - using a query specification, employ a set of filters(search keywords, search tags and conditional statemnts) 
#         Ex: ("hasAttribute='name' AND size >= 2.4kb keyword1 keyword2")
#     - can be transformed to metamodel MM_4
#     - contains specified meta-classes and keywords
#     - has a quality above a specified threshold .
