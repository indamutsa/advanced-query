# if you want to use MongoDB change streams instead of legacy oplog tailing use change-stream-namespaces
# change streams require at least MongoDB API 3.6+
# if you have MongoDB 4+ you can listen for changes to an entire database or entire deployment

# to listen to an entire db use only the database name.  For a deployment use an empty string.
