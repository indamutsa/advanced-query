## Create Kubernetes cluster

```bash
cd kubernetes/rbac
kind create cluster --name rbac --image kindest/node:v1.26.3
```

## Kubernetes CA Certificate

Kubernetes does not have a concept of users, instead it relies on certificates and would only
trust certificates signed by its own CA. </br>

To get the CA certificates for our cluster, easiest way is to access the master node. </br>
Because we run on `kind`, our master node is a docker container. </br>
The CA certificates exists in the `/etc/kubernetes/pki` folder by default. </br>
If you are using `minikube` you may find it under `~/.minikube/.`

Access the master node:

```bash
docker exec -it rbac-control-plane bash

ls -l /etc/kubernetes/pki
total 60
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1135 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver-etcd-client.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1675 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver-etcd-client.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1143 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver-kubelet-client.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1679 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver-kubelet-client.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1306 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1675 Sep 10 01:38 apiserver.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1066 Sep 10 01:38 ca.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1675 Sep 10 01:38 ca.key
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep 10 01:38 etcd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1078 Sep 10 01:38 front-proxy-ca.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1679 Sep 10 01:38 front-proxy-ca.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1103 Sep 10 01:38 front-proxy-client.crt
-rw------- 1 root root 1675 Sep 10 01:38 front-proxy-client.key
-rw------- 1 root root 1679 Sep 10 01:38 sa.key
-rw------- 1 root root  451 Sep 10 01:38 sa.pub

exit the container
```

# Kubernetes Users

As mentioned before, Kubernetes has no concept of users, it trusts certificates that is signed by its CA. <br/>
This allows a lot of flexibility as Kubernetes lets you bring your own auth mechanisms, such as [OpenID Connect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) or OAuth. </br>

 <p> This allows managed Kubernetes offerings to use their cloud logins to authenticate. </p>

So on Azure, I can use my Microsoft account, GKE my Google account and AWS EKS my Amazon account. </br>

You will need to consult your cloud provider to setup authentication. </br>
Example [Azure AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration-cli)

## User Certificates

First thing we need to do is create a certificate signed by our Kubernetes CA. </br>
We have the CA, let's make a certificate. </br>

Easy way to create a cert is use `openssl` and the easiest way to get `openssl` is to simply run a container:

```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work -v ${HOME}:/root/ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net host alpine sh
```

Install these utilities:

```bash
# Delete previous certs
rm -f *.crt *.key *.srl *.csr *.pem

# Grant access to our user from the container
chown 1000:1000 -R /work

# Install utilities
apk add --no-cache openssl curl docker nano
```

Copy the certs out of our master node:

```bash
docker cp rbac-control-plane:/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt ca.crt
docker cp rbac-control-plane:/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key ca.key
```

Let's create a certificate for Bob Smith:

```bash
#start with a private key
openssl genrsa -out bob.key 2048

```

Now we have a key, we need a certificate signing request (CSR). </br>
We also need to specify the groups that Bob belongs to. </br>
Let's pretend Bob is part of the `Shopping` team and will be developing
applications for the `Shopping`

```bash
openssl req -new -key bob.key -out bob.csr -subj "/CN=Bob Smith/O=Shopping"
```

Use the CA to generate our certificate by signing our CSR. </br>
We may set an expiry on our certificate as well

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in bob.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out bob.crt -days 1
```

## Building a kube config

Install kind to access the cluster

```bash
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.17.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

Let's install `kubectl` in our container to make things easier:

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

<!-- We will try to avoid messing with our current kubernetes config. </br>
So lets tell `kubectl` to look at a new config that does not yet exists

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config
``` -->

<!-- Create a cluster entry which points to the cluster and contains the details of the CA certificate:

Get the server link from the last kubeconfig and replace the server link with the one in the next command. That means this should be changed `--server=https://127.0.0.1:52807`

so
Run this command, get the new one: -->

<!-- ```bash
# kubectl config view | grep "server: https://127.0.0.1" | awk '{print "--server="$2}'
kubectl config view --minify --context=$(kubectl config current-context) -o=jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}'

```

```bash
kubectl config set-cluster dev-cluster --server=https://127.0.0.1:36355 \
--certificate-authority=ca.crt \
--embed-certs=true

#see changes
nano ~/.kube/new-config
``` -->

Let us combine some commends below:
We are going to set a new cluster entry in our new kubeconfig file. </br>
This is very important to avoid messing with our current kubeconfig. But beforefore we do that, we shall extract the server url from the current kubeconfig. </br>
We will replace that with the new server url in the next command. </br> And then we will set the cluster entry in our new kubeconfig file. </br>

```bash
# Let us make sure we get this KUBECONFIG variable out of the way
rm ~/.kube/new-config

# We extract the server url from the current kubeconfig
server_url=$(kubectl config view --minify --context=$(kubectl config current-context) -o=jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}')

# We set the new kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config

# We set the cluster entry
kubectl config set-cluster dev-cluster --server=$server_url \
--certificate-authority=ca.crt \
--embed-certs=true

nano ~/.kube/new-config
```

Now we need to create a user entry for Bob Smith.

```bash
kubectl config set-credentials bob --client-certificate=bob.crt --client-key=bob.key --embed-certs=true
kubectl config set-context dev --cluster=dev-cluster --namespace=shopping --user=bob

# If you query the nodes, you will see that we are not able to access the cluster because the context is not set
kubectl get nodes

# We set the context
kubectl config use-context dev

kubectl get pods
```

Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "Bob Smith" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "shopping"

## Give Bob Smith Access

This time, we need to go back to our master node to create a role and rolebinding. </br>
So change the KUBECONFIG back to the default one

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```

Now let us give our buddy Bob Smith access to the cluster. </br>

```bash
cd kubernetes/rbac # if you are not already there
# Create a new namespace for our shopping team

# This is already created
kubectl create ns shopping

kubectl -n shopping apply -f role.yaml
kubectl -n shopping apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

## Test Access as Bob

Go back to Bob KUBECONFIG

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config
```

```bash
kubectl get pods
No resources found in shopping namespace.
```

# Kubernetes Service Accounts

So we've covered users, but what about applications or services running in our cluster ? </br>
Most business apps will not need to connect to the kubernetes API unless you are building something that integrates with your cluster, like a CI/CD tool, an autoscaler or a custom webhook. </br>

Generally applications will use a service account to connect. </br>
You can read more about [Kubernetes Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).

Let's deploy a service account. But remember, we are still using Bob's kubeconfig, so we need to change it back to the default one

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
kubectl -n shopping apply -f serviceaccount.yaml
```

Now we can deploy a pod that uses the service account, let us change the KUBECONFIG back to Bob's

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config
```

Now let us run the pod that uses the service account we just created.

```bash
kubectl -n shopping apply -f pod.yaml
```

Now we can test the access from within that pod by trying to list pods, remember we gave Bob to pod/exec in the shopping namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n shopping exec -it shopping-api -- bash

# Point to the internal API server hostname
APISERVER=https://kubernetes.default.svc

# Path to ServiceAccount token
SERVICEACCOUNT=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

# Read this Pod's namespace
NAMESPACE=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/namespace)

# Read the ServiceAccount bearer token
TOKEN=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/token)

# Reference the internal certificate authority (CA)
CACERT=${SERVICEACCOUNT}/ca.crt

# Now let us test access using our servicename inside the pod to List pods through the API
curl --cacert ${CACERT} --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -s ${APISERVER}/api/v1/namespaces/shopping/pods/

# we should see the error below for not having access
-----
# root@shopping-api:/# curl --cacert ${CACERT} --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -s ${APISERVER}/api/v1/namespaces/shopping/pods/
# {
#   "kind": "Status",
#   "apiVersion": "v1",
#   "metadata": {},
#   "status": "Failure",
#   "message": "pods is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:shopping:shopping-api\" cannot list resource \"pods\" in API group \"\" in the namespace \"shopping\"",
#   "reason": "Forbidden",
#   "details": {
#     "kind": "pods"
#   },
#   "code": 403
# }root@shopping-api:/#
```

To allow this pod to list pods in the shopping namespace, we need to create a role and rolebinding for the service account from our master node

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

# Now we can allow this pod to list pods in the shopping namespace
kubectl -n shopping apply -f serviceaccount-role.yaml
kubectl -n shopping apply -f serviceaccount-rolebinding.yaml
```

Now let us test access using our servicename inside the pod to List pods through the API.

We go back in bob's kubeconfig

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/new-config
```

And we access the pod using instructions at line 264.
If we try run `curl` command again we can see now we are able to get a json
response with pod information

Key Note:
ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding look the same as Role and RoleBinding, but they are cluster wide. </br>
So if you want to give access to a service account across all namespaces, you would use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding. </br>

And be careful when giving a user ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding, because you can give access him the entire cluster. </br>
