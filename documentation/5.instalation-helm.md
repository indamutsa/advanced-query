## RUN THE CLUSTER using HELM

---

I like editing the yaml using the script and generate the yaml using the script, this way I can keep track of the changes I made to the yaml file in one single source of truth.
The script I am using is the hello folder and it is called `spin-templates.sh`

You can run the script to generate data after editing the templates:

```bash
# The scrui
./../hello/spin-templates.sh # While in templates folder
```

this will generate the yaml files in the templates folder.

To run the cluster:
cdhange the directory to cluster-helm-deployment, and run the following commands:

```bash
helm install mdeforge . -f values.yaml
```

In case you want to visualize all yaml files generated by helm, you can run the following command:

```bash
helm template mdeforge . -f values.yaml
# It can be forwarded to a file like this:
helm template mdeforge . -f values.yaml > mdeforge.yaml
```

## Essential terraform commands

Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. The `--yes` flag you mentioned doesn't exist directly in Terraform as of my last training cut-off in September 2021. However, Terraform does have a `-auto-approve` flag which skips the interactive approval of plan executions.

Here are some common Terraform commands:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up the backend and downloads required providers.

```bash

terraform init

```

2. **Validating the Configuration**: Checks if the configuration files in the directory are syntactically valid and internally consistent.

```bash

terraform validate

```

3. **Generating an Execution Plan**: Shows you what will happen when you apply your configuration.

```bash

terraform plan

```

4. **Applying the Configuration**: Applies the changes required to achieve the desired state of the configuration.

```bash

terraform apply

```

If you want to automatically approve the apply without seeing the plan (not recommended for production use):

```bash

terraform apply -auto-approve

```

5. **Destroy**: Destroys all the resources that have been created.

```bash

terraform destroy

```

To automatically approve the destruction:

```bash

terraform destroy -auto-approve

```

6. **Refreshing the State**: Updates the local state file with the current state of the infrastructure.

```bash

terraform refresh

```

7. **Outputting**: Shows the outputs from your configuration.

```bash

terraform output

```

8. **Formatting**: Rewrites Terraform configuration files in the standard format.

```bash

terraform fmt

```

9. **Importing Existing Infrastructure**: Takes already running infrastructure and brings it under Terraform management.

```bash

terraform import [arguments] ADDRESS ID

```

10. **Workspace Management**: Manages workspaces, which allow for multiple distinct sets of infrastructure resources.

```bash

terraform workspace list
terraform workspace select NAME
terraform workspace new NAME
terraform workspace delete NAME

```

Remember, Terraform can be a very powerful tool, and with the `-auto-approve` flag, you can potentially make large changes without confirmation. Always be sure you understand the implications of your commands, especially when working with real-world infrastructure.
