## Kubernetes deployment

Now that we have deployed the system using docker-compose, let us deploy it using Kubernetes. We will use Minikube to deploy the system locally. You can also use a cloud provider such as AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy the system.

We are going to use kind to deploy the system. Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”. kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

Let us first get a working container. Everything will be installed via a disposable container to avoid installing various on your host. Run the command below in your host terminal in the folder cloned.

First let us go insdide the folder `cloud-helm-deployment` and run the following command:

```bash
# Go inside template folder
./../hello/spin-templates.sh # This shall produce yaml file as templates

# Run the following command to generate the yaml file of the whole cluster. We are piping the output to a file called mdeforge.yaml
# This file has all the yaml files of the cluster
helm template mdeforge . -f values.yaml > mdeforge.yaml

# Move this file to hello folder
mv mdeforge.yaml ../hello

# Go inside hello folder
cd ../hello

# Run the following command to generate the yaml file of the whole cluster. We are piping the output to a file called mdeforge.yaml
# This file has all the yaml files of the cluster
kubectl apply -f mdeforge.yaml
```
